  ## Energy Aware Mining

  This page contains pointers to all the primary data we used to conduct our study on energy-aware commits, please refer to them below.

  ## [Analysis Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_BG3Uph2D-DlISZTh4O-qKipUtbUMJm4wUJzrpz3koU/edit?usp=sharing) ##
  This spreadsheet is a public Google Spreadsheet document that holds all the results of our analysis. Download it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_BG3Uph2D-DlISZTh4O-qKipUtbUMJm4wUJzrpz3koU/edit?usp=sharing).

  It includes the following sheets:

  - __Dashboard__: contains aggregated data about overall statistics discussed in the paper.
  - __Analysis__: contains the bulk of the commits data and it also contains the final theme assigned to each commits.
  - __OKs-Metadata__: contains metadata for the Git repositories that contain at least one "OK" commit.
  - __OKs-Metrics__: contains overall metrics over the "OKs-metadata" data.


  ## [MongoDb Dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wz-3gJt0yTUUFZYXRmYy0zLUk/view?usp=sharing) ##

  This dump contais GitHub metadata about users, repositories and commits and is primarily meant to be used for replication purposes since some of GitHub's data may become inaccessible*. Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wz-3gJt0yTUUFZYXRmYy0zLUk/view?usp=sharing)

  It was created on 01/31/2015 and last updated on 02/14/2015. It uses the same structure of the Github JSON API.

  It contains the following collections:

  - __users__: [User metadata for repository owners](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).
  - __repos__: [Repository metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).
  - __commits__: [Commits metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#get-a-single-commit).
  - __committers__: [User metadata for commit committers](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).
  - __authors__: [User metadata for commit authors](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).
  - __blobs__: [Commits blobs for commit files contents](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/blobs/).


  *Some of the metadata was already not available when trying to download it from Github. This might be due to several reasons: the project could have been renamed or removed, the project owner may have left Github, or the branch where the commit was placed was removed.
